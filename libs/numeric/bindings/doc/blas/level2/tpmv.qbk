[section tpmv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `tpmv` available, please see below.
``
tpmv( const MatrixAP& ap, VectorX& x );
``


[heading Description]

`tpmv` (short for triangular, packed,  matrix-vector operation) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines STPMV, DTPMV, CTPMV, and ZTPMV. 
`tpmv` performs one of the matrix-vector operations

x := A*x, or x := A**T*x, or x := A**H*x,

where x is an n element vector and A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of tpmv.
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][STPMV][cblas_stpmv][cublasStpmv] ]
[  [`double`][DTPMV][cblas_dtpmv][cublasDtpmv] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTPMV][cblas_ctpmv][cublasCtpmv] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTPMV][cblas_ztpmv][cublasZtpmv] ]

The original routines STPMV, DTPMV, CTPMV, and ZTPMV have seven arguments,
whereas `tpmv` requires two arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/tpmv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::tpmv( x, y, z );

``

this will output
