[section spr2]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spr2` available, please see below.
``
spr2( const Scalar >, const VectorX& x, const VectorY& y, MatrixAP& ap );
``


[heading Description]

`spr2` (short for symmetric, packed,  rank-2 update) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SSPR2 and DSPR2. 
`spr2` performs the symmetric rank 2 operation

A := alpha*x*y**T + alpha*y*x**T + A,

where alpha is a scalar, x and y are n element vectors and A is an
n by n symmetric matrix, supplied in packed form.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place.

[  [ Value type of VectorX ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSPR2][cblas_sspr2][cublasSspr2] ]
[  [`double`][DSPR2][cblas_dspr2][cublasDspr2] ]

]

The original routines SSPR2 and DSPR2 have eight arguments,
whereas `spr2` requires four arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/spr2.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::spr2( x, y, z );

``

this will output
