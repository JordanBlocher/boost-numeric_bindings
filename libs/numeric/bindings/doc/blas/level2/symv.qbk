[section symv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `symv` available, please see below.
``
symv( const Scalar >, const MatrixA& a, const VectorX& x,
        const Scalar >, VectorY& y );
``


[heading Description]

`symv` (short for symmetric matrix-vector operation) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SSYMV and DSYMV. 
`symv` performs the matrix-vector operation

y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,

where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and
A is an n by n symmetric matrix.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of symv.
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSYMV][cblas_ssymv][cublasSsymv] ]
[  [`double`][DSYMV][cblas_dsymv][cublasDsymv] ]

]

The original routines SSYMV and DSYMV have ten arguments,
whereas `symv` requires five arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/symv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::symv( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
