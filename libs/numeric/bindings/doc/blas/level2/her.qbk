[section her]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `her` available, please see below.
``
her( const Scalar >, const VectorX& x, MatrixA& a );
``


[heading Description]

`her` (short for hermitian rank-1 update) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SSYR, DSYR, CHER, and ZHER. 
`her` performs the hermitian rank 1 operation

A := alpha*x*x**H + A,

where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an
n by n hermitian matrix.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of her.
[  [ Value type of VectorX ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSYR][cblas_ssyr][cublasSsyr] ]
[  [`double`][DSYR][cblas_dsyr][cublasDsyr] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CHER][cblas_cher][cublasCher] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHER][cblas_zher][cublasZher] ]

The original routines SSYR, DSYR, CHER, and ZHER have seven arguments,
whereas `her` requires three arguments.
