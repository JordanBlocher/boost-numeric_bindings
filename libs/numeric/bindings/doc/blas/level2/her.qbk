[section her]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `her` available, please see below.
``
her( const Scalar >, const VectorViewX& x, MatrixA& a );
``


[heading Description]

`her` (short for hermitian rank-1 update) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines CHER and ZHER. 
`her` performs the hermitian rank 1 operation

A := alpha*x*conjg( x' ) + A,

where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an
n by n hermitian matrix.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorViewX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorViewX>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of her.

[  [`complex<float>`][CHER][cblas_cher][cublasCher] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHER][cblas_zher][Unavailable] ]

]

The original routines CHER and ZHER have seven arguments,
whereas `her` requires three arguments.

``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/her.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::her( x, y, z );

``

this will output
