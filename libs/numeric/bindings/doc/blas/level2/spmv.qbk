[section spmv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spmv` available, please see below.
``
spmv( const Scalar >, const MatrixAP& ap, const VectorX& x,
        const Scalar >, VectorY& y );
``


[heading Description]

`spmv` (short for symmetric, packed,  matrix-vector operation) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SSPMV and DSPMV. 
`spmv` performs the matrix-vector operation

y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,

where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and
A is an n by n symmetric matrix, supplied in packed form.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of spmv.
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSPMV][cblas_sspmv][cublasSspmv] ]
[  [`double`][DSPMV][cblas_dspmv][cublasDspmv] ]

]

The original routines SSPMV and DSPMV have nine arguments,
whereas `spmv` requires five arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/spmv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::spmv( x, y, z );

``

this will output
