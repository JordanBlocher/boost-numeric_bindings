[section ger]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ger` available, please see below.
``
ger( const Scalar >, const VectorX& x, const VectorY& y, MatrixA& a );
``


[heading Description]

`ger` (short for generic rank-1 update) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SGER and DGER. 
`ger` performs the rank 1 operation

A := alpha*x*y**T + A,

where alpha is a scalar, x is an m element vector, y is an n element
vector and A is an m by n matrix.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of ger.
[  [ Value type of VectorX ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SGER][cblas_sger][cublasSger] ]
[  [`double`][DGER][cblas_dger][cublasDger] ]

]

The original routines SGER and DGER have nine arguments,
whereas `ger` requires four arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/ger.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::ger( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
