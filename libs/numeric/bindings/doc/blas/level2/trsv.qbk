[section trsv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `trsv` available, please see below.
``
trsv( const MatrixA& a, VectorX& x );
``


[heading Description]

`trsv` (short for triangular solve system of equations) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines STRSV, DTRSV, CTRSV, and ZTRSV. 
`trsv` solves one of the systems of equations

A*x = b, or A**T*x = b, or A**H*x = b,

where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.

No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of trsv.
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][STRSV][cblas_strsv][cublasStrsv] ]
[  [`double`][DTRSV][cblas_dtrsv][cublasDtrsv] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTRSV][cblas_ctrsv][cublasCtrsv] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTRSV][cblas_ztrsv][cublasZtrsv] ]

The original routines STRSV, DTRSV, CTRSV, and ZTRSV have eight arguments,
whereas `trsv` requires two arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level2/trsv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::trsv( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
