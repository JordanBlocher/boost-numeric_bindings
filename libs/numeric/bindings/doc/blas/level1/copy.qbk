[section copy]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `copy` available, please see below.
``
copy( const VectorX& x, VectorY& y );
``


[heading Description]

`copy` (short for TODO) provides a C++
interface to BLAS routines SCOPY, DCOPY, CCOPY, and ZCOPY. 


The selection of the BLAS routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
Table X below illustrates to which specific routine this dispatching will take place. 

[table Dispatching of copy.
[  [ Value type of VectorX ] [BLAS routine] [CBLAS routine] [CUBLAS routine] ]
[  [`float`][SCOPY][cblas_scopy][cublasScopy] ]
[  [`double`][DCOPY][cblas_dcopy][cublasDcopy] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CCOPY][cblas_ccopy][cublasCcopy] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZCOPY][cblas_zcopy][cublasZcopy] ]

]

The original routines SCOPY, DCOPY, CCOPY, and ZCOPY have five arguments,
whereas `copy` requires two arguments.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/blas/level1/copy.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

blas::copy( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
``
