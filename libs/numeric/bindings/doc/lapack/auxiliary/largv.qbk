[section largv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `largv` available, please see below.
``
largv( const int_t n, VectorX& x, VectorY& y, VectorC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`largv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SLARGV, DLARGV, CLARGV, and ZLARGV. 
`largv` generates a vector of complex plane rotations with real
cosines, determined by elements of the complex vectors x and y.
For i = 1,2,...,n

( c(i) s(i) ) ( x(i) ) = ( r(i) )
( -conjg(s(i)) c(i) ) ( y(i) ) = ( 0 )

where c(i)**2 + ABS(s(i))**2 = 1

The following conventions are used (these are the same as in ZLARTG,
but differ from the BLAS1 routine ZROTG):
If y(i)=0, then c(i)=1 and s(i)=0.
If x(i)=0, then c(i)=0 and s(i) is chosen so that r(i) is real.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
