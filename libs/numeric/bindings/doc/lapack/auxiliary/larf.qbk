[section larf]

[heading Prototype]
There are two prototypes of `larf` available, please see below.
``
larf( const Side side, const VectorV& v, const Scalar >, MatrixC& c );
``

``
larf( const Side side, const VectorV& v, const Scalar tau, MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`larf` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SLARF, DLARF, CLARF, and ZLARF. 
`larf` applies a complex elementary reflector H to a complex M-by-N
matrix C, from either the left or the right. H is represented in the
form

H = I - tau * v * v'

where tau is a complex scalar and v is a complex vector.

If tau = 0, then H is taken to be the unit matrix.

To apply H' (the conjugate transpose of H), supply conjg(tau) instead
tau.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorV`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorV>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of larf
[  [ Value type of VectorV ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SLARF] ]
[  [`double`][DLARF] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CLARF] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZLARF] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/auxiliary/larf.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::larf( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
