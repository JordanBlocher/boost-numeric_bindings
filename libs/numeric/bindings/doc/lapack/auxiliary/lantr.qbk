[section lantr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `lantr` available, please see below.
``
lantr( const char norm, const MatrixA& a );
``


[heading Description]

`lantr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SLANTR, DLANTR, CLANTR, and ZLANTR. 
`lantr` returns the value of the one norm, or the Frobenius norm, or
the infinity norm, or the element of largest absolute value of a
trapezoidal or triangular matrix A.

Description
===========

`lantr` returns the value

`lantr` = ( max(abs(A(i,j))), NORM = 'M' or 'm'
(
( norm1(A),  NORM = '1', 'O' or 'o'
(
( normI(A),  NORM = 'I' or 'i'
(
( normF(A),  NORM = 'F', 'f', 'E' or 'e'

where norm1 denotes the one norm of a matrix (maximum column sum),
normI denotes the infinity norm of a matrix (maximum row sum) and
normF denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix (square root of sum of
squares). Note that max(abs(A(i,j))) is not a consistent matrix norm.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of lantr

[  [`double`][DLANTR] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CLANTR] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZLANTR] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/auxiliary/lantr.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::lantr( x, y, z );

``

this will output
