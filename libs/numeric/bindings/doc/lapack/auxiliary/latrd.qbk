[section latrd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `latrd` available, please see below.
``
latrd( const int_t nb, MatrixA& a, VectorE& e,
        VectorTAU& tau, MatrixW& w );
``


[heading Description]

`latrd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SLATRD, DLATRD, CLATRD, and ZLATRD. 
`latrd` reduces NB rows and columns of a complex Hermitian matrix A to
Hermitian tridiagonal form by a unitary similarity
transformation Q' * A * Q, and returns the matrices V and W which are
needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced part of A.

If UPLO = 'U', `latrd` reduces the last NB rows and columns of a
matrix, of which the upper triangle is supplied;
if UPLO = 'L', `latrd` reduces the first NB rows and columns of a
matrix, of which the lower triangle is supplied.

This is an auxiliary routine called by ZHETRD.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of latrd
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]

[  [`double`][DLATRD] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CLATRD] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZLATRD] ]
