[section lacgv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `lacgv` available, please see below.
``
lacgv( const int_t n, VectorX& x,
        const int_t incx );
``


[heading Description]

`lacgv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines CLACGV and ZLACGV. 
`lacgv` conjugates a complex vector of length N.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorX`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorX>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/auxiliary/lacgv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::lacgv( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
