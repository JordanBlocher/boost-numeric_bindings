[section gbcon]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `gbcon` available, please see below.
``
gbcon( const char norm, const MatrixAB& ab, const VectorIPIV& ipiv,
        const Scalar >, Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`gbcon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SGBCON, DGBCON, CGBCON, and ZGBCON. 
`gbcon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
general band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm,
using the LU factorization computed by ZGBTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as
RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of gbcon
[  [ Value type of MatrixAB ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SGBCON] ]
[  [`double`][DGBCON] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CGBCON] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZGBCON] ]
