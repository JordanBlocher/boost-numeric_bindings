[section geqp3]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `geqp3` available, please see below.
``
geqp3( MatrixA& a, VectorJPVT& jpvt, VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`geqp3` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SGEQP3, DGEQP3, CGEQP3, and ZGEQP3. 
`geqp3` computes a QR factorization with column pivoting of a
matrix A: A*P = Q*R using Level 3 BLAS.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of geqp3
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SGEQP3] ]
[  [`double`][DGEQP3] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CGEQP3] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZGEQP3] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/geqp3.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::geqp3( x, y, z );

``

this will output
