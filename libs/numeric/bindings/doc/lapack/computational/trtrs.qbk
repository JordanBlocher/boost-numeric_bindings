[section trtrs]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `trtrs` available, please see below.
``
trtrs( const MatrixA& a, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`trtrs` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines STRTRS, DTRTRS, CTRTRS, and ZTRTRS. 
`trtrs` solves a triangular system of the form

A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,

where A is a triangular matrix of order N, and B is an N-by-NRHS
matrix. A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of trtrs
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][STRTRS] ]
[  [`double`][DTRTRS] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTRTRS] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTRTRS] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/trtrs.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::trtrs( x, y, z );

``

this will output
