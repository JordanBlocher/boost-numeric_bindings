[section ungrq]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ungrq` available, please see below.
``
ungrq( MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`ungrq` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORGRQ, DORGRQ, CUNGRQ, and ZUNGRQ. 
`ungrq` generates an M-by-N complex matrix Q with orthonormal rows,
which is defined as the last M rows of a product of K elementary
reflectors of order N

Q = H(1)' H(2)' . . . H(k)'

as returned by ZGERQF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of ungrq
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SORGRQ] ]
[  [`double`][DORGRQ] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CUNGRQ] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZUNGRQ] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/ungrq.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::ungrq( x, y, z );

``

this will output
