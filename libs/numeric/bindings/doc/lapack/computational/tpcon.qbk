[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `tpcon` available, please see below.
``
tpcon( const char norm, const MatrixAP& ap, Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`tpcon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines STPCON, DTPCON, CTPCON, and ZTPCON. 
`tpcon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a packed
triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.

The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
computed as
RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of tpcon
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][STPCON] ]
[  [`double`][DTPCON] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTPCON] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTPCON] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/tpcon.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::tpcon( x, y, z );

``

this will output
