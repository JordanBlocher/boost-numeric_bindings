[section upgtr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `upgtr` available, please see below.
``
upgtr( const char uplo, const VectorAP& ap, const VectorTAU& tau,
        MatrixQ& q );
``


[heading Description]

`upgtr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SOPGTR, DOPGTR, CUPGTR, and ZUPGTR. 
`upgtr` generates a complex unitary matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors H(i) of order n, as returned by
ZHPTRD using packed storage:

if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),

if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of upgtr
[  [ Value type of VectorAP ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SOPGTR] ]
[  [`double`][DOPGTR] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CUPGTR] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZUPGTR] ]
