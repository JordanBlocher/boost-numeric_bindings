[section sbtrd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sbtrd` available, please see below.
``
sbtrd( const char vect, MatrixAB& ab, VectorD& d, VectorE& e,
        MatrixQ& q );
``


[heading Description]

`sbtrd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBTRD and DSBTRD. 
`sbtrd` reduces a real symmetric band matrix A to symmetric
tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity transformation:
Q**T * A * Q = T.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/sbtrd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sbtrd( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
``
