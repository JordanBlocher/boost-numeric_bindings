[section unmbr]

[heading Prototype]
There are two prototypes of `unmbr` available, please see below.
``
unmbr( const char vect, const Side side, const MatrixA& a,
        const VectorTAU& tau, MatrixC& c );
``

``
unmbr( const char vect, const Side side, const int_t k,
        const MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau, MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`unmbr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORMBR, DORMBR, CUNMBR, and ZUNMBR. 
If VECT = 'Q', `unmbr` overwrites the general complex M-by-N matrix C
with
SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': Q * C  C * Q
TRANS = 'C': Q**H * C C * Q**H

If VECT = 'P', `unmbr` overwrites the general complex M-by-N matrix C
with
SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': P * C  C * P
TRANS = 'C': P**H * C C * P**H

Here Q and P**H are the unitary matrices determined by ZGEBRD when
reducing a complex matrix A to bidiagonal form: A = Q * B * P**H. Q
and P**H are defined as products of elementary reflectors H(i) and
G(i) respectively.

Let nq = m if SIDE = 'L' and nq = n if SIDE = 'R'. Thus nq is the
order of the unitary matrix Q or P**H that is applied.

If VECT = 'Q', A is assumed to have been an NQ-by-K matrix:
if nq >= k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k);
if nq < k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nq-1).

If VECT = 'P', A is assumed to have been a K-by-NQ matrix:
if k < nq, P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(k);
if k >= nq, P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(nq-1).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of unmbr
