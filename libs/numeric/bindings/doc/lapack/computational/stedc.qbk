[section stedc]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `stedc` available, please see below.
``
stedc( const char compz, VectorD& d, VectorE& e, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`stedc` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSTEDC, DSTEDC, CSTEDC, and ZSTEDC. 
`stedc` computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the divide and conquer method.
The eigenvectors of a full or band complex Hermitian matrix can also
be found if ZHETRD or ZHPTRD or ZHBTRD has been used to reduce this
matrix to tridiagonal form.

This code makes very mild assumptions about floating point
arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard digit in
add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard digits
which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or Cray-2.
It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none. See DLAED3 for details.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorD`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorD>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of stedc

[  [`double`][DSTEDC] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CSTEDC] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZSTEDC] ]
