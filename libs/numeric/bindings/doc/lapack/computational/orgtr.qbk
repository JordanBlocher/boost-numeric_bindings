[section orgtr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `orgtr` available, please see below.
``
orgtr( const int_t n, MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`orgtr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORGTR and DORGTR. 
`orgtr` generates a real orthogonal matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors of order N, as returned by
DSYTRD:

if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),

if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/orgtr.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::orgtr( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
