[section hetrf]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hetrf` available, please see below.
``
hetrf( MatrixA& a, VectorIPIV& ipiv );
``


[heading Description]

`hetrf` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYTRF, DSYTRF, CHETRF, and ZHETRF. 
`hetrf` computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method. The form of the
factorization is

A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H

where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of hetrf
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSYTRF] ]
[  [`double`][DSYTRF] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CHETRF] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHETRF] ]
