[section hpcon]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hpcon` available, please see below.
``
hpcon( const MatrixAP& ap, const VectorIPIV& ipiv, const Scalar >,
        Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`hpcon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPCON, DSPCON, CHPCON, and ZHPCON. 
`hpcon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
Hermitian packed matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
A = L*D*L**H computed by ZHPTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of hpcon

[  [`double`][DSPCON] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CHPCON] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHPCON] ]
