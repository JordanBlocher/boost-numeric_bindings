[section ungql]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ungql` available, please see below.
``
ungql( MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`ungql` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORGQL, DORGQL, CUNGQL, and ZUNGQL. 
`ungql` generates an M-by-N complex matrix Q with orthonormal columns,
which is defined as the last N columns of a product of K elementary
reflectors of order M

Q = H(k) . . . H(2) H(1)

as returned by ZGEQLF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of ungql
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SORGQL] ]
[  [`double`][DORGQL] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CUNGQL] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZUNGQL] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/ungql.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::ungql( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
