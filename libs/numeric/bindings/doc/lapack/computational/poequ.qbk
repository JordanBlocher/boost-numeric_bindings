[section poequ]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `poequ` available, please see below.
``
poequ( const MatrixA& a, VectorS& s, Scalar >, Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`poequ` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPOEQU, DPOEQU, CPOEQU, and ZPOEQU. 
`poequ` computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
Hermitian positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
(with respect to the two-norm). S contains the scale factors,
S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal. This
choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of poequ
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SPOEQU] ]
[  [`double`][DPOEQU] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CPOEQU] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPOEQU] ]
