[section sptrd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sptrd` available, please see below.
``
sptrd( MatrixAP& ap, VectorD& d, VectorE& e, VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`sptrd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPTRD and DSPTRD. 
`sptrd` reduces a real symmetric matrix A stored in packed form to
symmetric tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity
transformation: Q**T * A * Q = T.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/sptrd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sptrd( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
