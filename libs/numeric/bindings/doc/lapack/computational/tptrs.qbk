[section tptrs]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `tptrs` available, please see below.
``
tptrs( const MatrixAP& ap, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`tptrs` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines STPTRS, DTPTRS, CTPTRS, and ZTPTRS. 
`tptrs` solves a triangular system of the form

A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,

where A is a triangular matrix of order N stored in packed format,
and B is an N-by-NRHS matrix. A check is made to verify that A is
nonsingular.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of tptrs
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][STPTRS] ]
[  [`double`][DTPTRS] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTPTRS] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTPTRS] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/tptrs.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::tptrs( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
