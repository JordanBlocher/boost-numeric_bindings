[section potri]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `potri` available, please see below.
``
potri( MatrixA& a );
``


[heading Description]

`potri` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPOTRI, DPOTRI, CPOTRI, and ZPOTRI. 
`potri` computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H
computed by ZPOTRF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of potri
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SPOTRI] ]
[  [`double`][DPOTRI] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CPOTRI] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPOTRI] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/potri.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::potri( x, y, z );

``

this will output
