[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ppcon` available, please see below.
``
ppcon( const MatrixAP& ap, const Scalar >, Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`ppcon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPPCON, DPPCON, CPPCON, and ZPPCON. 
`ppcon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite packed matrix using
the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
ZPPTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/ppcon.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::ppcon( x, y, z );

``
