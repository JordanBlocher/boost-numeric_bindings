[section gebrd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `gebrd` available, please see below.
``
gebrd( MatrixA& a, VectorD& d, VectorE& e, VectorTAUQ& tauq,
        VectorTAUP& taup );
``


[heading Description]

`gebrd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SGEBRD, DGEBRD, CGEBRD, and ZGEBRD. 
`gebrd` reduces a general complex M-by-N matrix A to upper or lower
bidiagonal form B by a unitary transformation: Q**H * A * P = B.

If m >= n, B is upper bidiagonal; if m < n, B is lower bidiagonal.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of gebrd
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SGEBRD] ]
[  [`double`][DGEBRD] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CGEBRD] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZGEBRD] ]

``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/gebrd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::gebrd( x, y, z );

``
