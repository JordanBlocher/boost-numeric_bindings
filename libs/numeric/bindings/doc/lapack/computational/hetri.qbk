[section hetri]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hetri` available, please see below.
``
hetri( MatrixA& a, const VectorIPIV& ipiv );
``


[heading Description]

`hetri` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYTRI, DSYTRI, CHETRI, and ZHETRI. 
`hetri` computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix
A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H computed by
ZHETRF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of hetri
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSYTRI] ]
[  [`double`][DSYTRI] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CHETRI] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHETRI] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/hetri.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::hetri( x, y, z );

``

this will output
