[section spcon]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spcon` available, please see below.
``
spcon( const MatrixAP& ap, const VectorIPIV& ipiv, const Scalar >,
        Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`spcon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPCON, DSPCON, CSPCON, and ZSPCON. 
`spcon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex symmetric packed matrix A using the
factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSPTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of spcon
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSPCON] ]
[  [`double`][DSPCON] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CSPCON] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZSPCON] ]
