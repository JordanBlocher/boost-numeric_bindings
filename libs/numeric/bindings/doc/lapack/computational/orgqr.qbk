[section orgqr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `orgqr` available, please see below.
``
orgqr( MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau );
``


[heading Description]

`orgqr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORGQR and DORGQR. 
`orgqr` generates an M-by-N real matrix Q with orthonormal columns,
which is defined as the first N columns of a product of K elementary
reflectors of order M

Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k)

as returned by DGEQRF.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/orgqr.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::orgqr( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
``
