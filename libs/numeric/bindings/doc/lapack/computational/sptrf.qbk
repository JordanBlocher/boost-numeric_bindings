[section sptrf]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sptrf` available, please see below.
``
sptrf( MatrixAP& ap, VectorIPIV& ipiv );
``


[heading Description]

`sptrf` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPTRF, DSPTRF, CSPTRF, and ZSPTRF. 
`sptrf` computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
stored in packed format using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting
method:

A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T

where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of sptrf
[  [ Value type of MatrixAP ] [LAPACK routine] ]

[  [`double`][DSPTRF] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CSPTRF] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZSPTRF] ]
