[section ormql]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ormql` available, please see below.
``
ormql( const Side side, MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau, MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`ormql` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORMQL and DORMQL. 
`ormql` overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C with

SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': Q * C  C * Q
TRANS = 'T': Q**T * C C * Q**T

where Q is a real orthogonal matrix defined as the product of k
elementary reflectors

Q = H(k) . . . H(2) H(1)

as returned by DGEQLF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N
if SIDE = 'R'.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/ormql.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::ormql( x, y, z );

``

this will output
