[section pocon]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `pocon` available, please see below.
``
pocon( const MatrixA& a, const Scalar >, Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`pocon` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPOCON, DPOCON, CPOCON, and ZPOCON. 
`pocon` estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix using the
Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by ZPOTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of pocon
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SPOCON] ]
[  [`double`][DPOCON] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CPOCON] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPOCON] ]
