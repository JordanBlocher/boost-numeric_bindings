[section trsen]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `trsen` available, please see below.
``
trsen( const char job, const char compq, const VectorSELECT& select,
        MatrixT& t, MatrixQ& q, VectorW& w, int_t& m, Scalar >,
        Scalar > );
``


[heading Description]

`trsen` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines CTRSEN and ZTRSEN. 
`trsen` reorders the Schur factorization of a complex matrix
A = Q*T*Q**H, so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues appears in
the leading positions on the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix
T, and the leading columns of Q form an orthonormal basis of the
corresponding right invariant subspace.

Optionally the routine computes the reciprocal condition numbers of
the cluster of eigenvalues and/or the invariant subspace.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorSELECT`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorSELECT>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/trsen.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::trsen( x, y, z );

``

this will output
