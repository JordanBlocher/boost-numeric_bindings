[section tbtrs]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `tbtrs` available, please see below.
``
tbtrs( const int_t kd, const MatrixAB& ab, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`tbtrs` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines STBTRS, DTBTRS, CTBTRS, and ZTBTRS. 
`tbtrs` solves a triangular system of the form

A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,

where A is a triangular band matrix of order N, and B is an
N-by-NRHS matrix. A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of tbtrs
[  [ Value type of MatrixAB ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][STBTRS] ]
[  [`double`][DTBTRS] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CTBTRS] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZTBTRS] ]
