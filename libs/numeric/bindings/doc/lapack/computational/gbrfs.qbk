[section gbrfs]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `gbrfs` available, please see below.
``
gbrfs( const MatrixAB& ab, const MatrixAFB& afb, const VectorIPIV& ipiv,
        const MatrixB& b, MatrixX& x, VectorFERR& ferr, VectorBERR& berr );
``


[heading Description]

`gbrfs` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SGBRFS, DGBRFS, CGBRFS, and ZGBRFS. 
`gbrfs` improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is banded, and provides
error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of gbrfs
[  [ Value type of MatrixAB ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SGBRFS] ]
[  [`double`][DGBRFS] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CGBRFS] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZGBRFS] ]

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/gbrfs.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::gbrfs( x, y, z );

``

this will output
