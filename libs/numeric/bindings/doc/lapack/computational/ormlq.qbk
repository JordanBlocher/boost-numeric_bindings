[section ormlq]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ormlq` available, please see below.
``
ormlq( const Side side, const MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau,
        MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`ormlq` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORMLQ and DORMLQ. 
`ormlq` overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C with

SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': Q * C  C * Q
TRANS = 'T': Q**T * C C * Q**T

where Q is a real orthogonal matrix defined as the product of k
elementary reflectors

Q = H(k) . . . H(2) H(1)

as returned by DGELQF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N
if SIDE = 'R'.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
