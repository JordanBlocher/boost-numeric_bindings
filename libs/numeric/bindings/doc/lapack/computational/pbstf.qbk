[section pbstf]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `pbstf` available, please see below.
``
pbstf( MatrixAB& ab );
``


[heading Description]

`pbstf` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPBSTF, DPBSTF, CPBSTF, and ZPBSTF. 
`pbstf` computes a split Cholesky factorization of a complex
Hermitian positive definite band matrix A.

This routine is designed to be used in conjunction with ZHBGST.

The factorization has the form A = S**H*S where S is a band matrix
of the same bandwidth as A and the following structure:

S = ( U )
( M L )

where U is upper triangular of order m = (n+kd)/2, and L is lower
triangular of order n-m.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of pbstf

[  [`complex<float>`][CPBSTF] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPBSTF] ]
