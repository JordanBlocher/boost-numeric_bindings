[section unmqr]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `unmqr` available, please see below.
``
unmqr( const Side side, const MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau,
        MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`unmqr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORMQR, DORMQR, CUNMQR, and ZUNMQR. 
`unmqr` overwrites the general complex M-by-N matrix C with

SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': Q * C  C * Q
TRANS = 'C': Q**H * C C * Q**H

where Q is a complex unitary matrix defined as the product of k
elementary reflectors

Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k)

as returned by ZGEQRF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N
if SIDE = 'R'.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of unmqr

[  [`complex<double>`][ZUNMQR] ]
