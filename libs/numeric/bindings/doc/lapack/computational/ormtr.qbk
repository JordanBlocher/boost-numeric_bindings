[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ormtr` available, please see below.
``
ormtr( const Side side, const MatrixA& a, const VectorTAU& tau,
        MatrixC& c );
``


[heading Description]

`ormtr` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SORMTR and DORMTR. 
`ormtr` overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C with

SIDE = 'L' SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N': Q * C  C * Q
TRANS = 'T': Q**T * C C * Q**T

where Q is a real orthogonal matrix of order nq, with nq = m if
SIDE = 'L' and nq = n if SIDE = 'R'. Q is defined as the product of
nq-1 elementary reflectors, as returned by DSYTRD:

if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(nq-1) . . . H(2) H(1);

if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nq-1).

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/computational/ormtr.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::ormtr( x, y, z );

``

this will output
