[section spgv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spgv` available, please see below.
``
spgv( const int_t itype, const char jobz, MatrixAP& ap,
        MatrixBP& bp, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`spgv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPGV and DSPGV. 
`spgv` computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x, A*Bx=(lambda)*x, or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.
Here A and B are assumed to be symmetric, stored in packed format,
and B is also positive definite.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/spgv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::spgv( x, y, z );

``

this will output
