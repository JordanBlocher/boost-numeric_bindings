[section sysv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sysv` available, please see below.
``
sysv( MatrixA& a, VectorIPIV& ipiv, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`sysv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYSV, DSYSV, CSYSV, and ZSYSV. 
`sysv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
matrices.

The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
A = U * D * U**T, if UPLO = 'U', or
A = L * D * L**T, if UPLO = 'L',
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks. The factored form of A is then
used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sysv.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sysv( x, y, z );

``

this will output
