[section syevx]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `syevx` available, please see below.
``
syevx( const char jobz, const char range, MatrixA& a, const Scalar >,
        const Scalar >, const int_t il,
        const int_t iu, const Scalar >, int_t& m,
        VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z, VectorIFAIL& ifail );
``


[heading Description]

`syevx` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSYEVX and DSYEVX. 
`syevx` computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric matrix A. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of indices
for the desired eigenvalues.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/syevx.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::syevx( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
