[section sbevx]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sbevx` available, please see below.
``
sbevx( const char jobz, const char range, MatrixAB& ab, MatrixQ& q,
        const Scalar >, const Scalar >, const int_t il,
        const int_t iu, const Scalar >, int_t& m,
        VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z, VectorIFAIL& ifail );
``


[heading Description]

`sbevx` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBEVX and DSBEVX. 
`sbevx` computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric band matrix A. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
indices for the desired eigenvalues.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sbevx.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sbevx( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
