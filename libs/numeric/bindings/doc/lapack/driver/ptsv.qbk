[section ptsv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `ptsv` available, please see below.
``
ptsv( VectorD& d, VectorE& e, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`ptsv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPTSV, DPTSV, CPTSV, and ZPTSV. 
`ptsv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal
matrix, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

A is factored as A = L*D*L**H, and the factored form of A is then
used to solve the system of equations.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `VectorD`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<VectorD>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of ptsv
[  [ Value type of VectorD ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SPTSV] ]
[  [`double`][DPTSV] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CPTSV] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPTSV] ]
