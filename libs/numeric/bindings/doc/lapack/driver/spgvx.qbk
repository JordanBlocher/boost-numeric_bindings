[section spgvx]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spgvx` available, please see below.
``
spgvx( const int_t itype, const char jobz, const char range,
        MatrixAP& ap, MatrixBP& bp, const Scalar >, const Scalar >,
        const int_t il, const int_t iu,
        const Scalar >, int_t& m, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z,
        VectorIFAIL& ifail );
``


[heading Description]

`spgvx` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPGVX and DSPGVX. 
`spgvx` computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally, eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x, A*Bx=(lambda)*x, or B*A*x=(lambda)*x. Here A
and B are assumed to be symmetric, stored in packed storage, and B
is also positive definite. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of indices
for the desired eigenvalues.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/spgvx.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::spgvx( x, y, z );

``

this will output
