[section gbsv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `gbsv` available, please see below.
``
gbsv( MatrixAB& ab, VectorIPIV& ipiv, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`gbsv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SGBSV, DGBSV, CGBSV, and ZGBSV. 
`gbsv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals
and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is
used to factor A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation
and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is
upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals. The factored form of A
is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
