[section pbsv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `pbsv` available, please see below.
``
pbsv( MatrixAB& ab, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`pbsv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPBSV, DPBSV, CPBSV, and ZPBSV. 
`pbsv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite band matrix and X
and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
A = U**H * U, if UPLO = 'U', or
A = L * L**H, if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
triangular band matrix, with the same number of superdiagonals or
subdiagonals as A. The factored form of A is then used to solve the
system of equations A * X = B.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
