[section sbev]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sbev` available, please see below.
``
sbev( const char jobz, MatrixAB& ab, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`sbev` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBEV and DSBEV. 
`sbev` computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
a real symmetric band matrix A.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sbev.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sbev( x, y, z );

``

this will output

``
[5] 0 1 2 3 4 5
