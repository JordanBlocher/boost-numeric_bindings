[section posv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `posv` available, please see below.
``
posv( MatrixA& a, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`posv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SPOSV, DPOSV, CPOSV, and ZPOSV. 
`posv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B
are N-by-NRHS matrices.

The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
A = U**H* U, if UPLO = 'U', or
A = L * L**H, if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
matrix. The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
equations A * X = B.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixA`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixA>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of posv
[  [ Value type of MatrixA ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SPOSV] ]
[  [`double`][DPOSV] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CPOSV] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZPOSV] ]
