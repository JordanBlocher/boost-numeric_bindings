[section hbevd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hbevd` available, please see below.
``
hbevd( const char jobz, MatrixAB& ab, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`hbevd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBEVD, DSBEVD, CHBEVD, and ZHBEVD. 
`hbevd` computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
a complex Hermitian band matrix A. If eigenvectors are desired, it
uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of hbevd
[  [ Value type of MatrixAB ] [LAPACK routine] ]
[  [`float`][SSBEVD] ]
[  [`double`][DSBEVD] ]
[  [`complex<float>`][CHBEVD] ]
[  [`complex<double>`][ZHBEVD] ]
