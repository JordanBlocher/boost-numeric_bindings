[section hpsv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hpsv` available, please see below.
``
hpsv( MatrixAP& ap, VectorIPIV& ipiv, MatrixB& b );
``


[heading Description]

`hpsv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPSV, DSPSV, CHPSV, and ZHPSV. 
`hpsv` computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix stored in packed format and X
and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
A = U * D * U**H, if UPLO = 'U', or
A = L * D * L**H, if UPLO = 'L',
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, D is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1-by-1
and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks. The factored form of A is then used to
solve the system of equations A * X = B.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.
