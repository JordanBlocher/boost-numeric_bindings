[section spevd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `spevd` available, please see below.
``
spevd( const char jobz, MatrixAP& ap, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`spevd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSPEVD and DSPEVD. 
`spevd` computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric matrix A in packed storage. If eigenvectors are
desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAP`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAP>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/spevd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::spevd( x, y, z );

``

this will output
