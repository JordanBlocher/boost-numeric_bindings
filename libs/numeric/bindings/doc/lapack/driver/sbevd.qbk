[section sbevd]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sbevd` available, please see below.
``
sbevd( const char jobz, MatrixAB& ab, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`sbevd` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBEVD and DSBEVD. 
`sbevd` computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
a real symmetric band matrix A. If eigenvectors are desired, it uses
a divide and conquer algorithm.

The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sbevd.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sbevd( x, y, z );

``

this will output
