[section hbgv]

[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `hbgv` available, please see below.
``
hbgv( const char jobz, MatrixAB& ab, MatrixBB& bb, VectorW& w,
        MatrixZ& z );
``


[heading Description]

`hbgv` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBGV, DSBGV, CHBGV, and ZHBGV. 
`hbgv` computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite banded eigenproblem, of
the form A*x=(lambda)*B*x. Here A and B are assumed to be Hermitian
and banded, and B is also positive definite.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated. 

[table Dispatching of hbgv
