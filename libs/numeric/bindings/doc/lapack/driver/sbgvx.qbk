[heading Prototype]
There is one prototype of `sbgvx` available, please see below.
``
sbgvx( const char jobz, const char range, MatrixAB& ab, MatrixBB& bb,
        MatrixQ& q, const Scalar >, const Scalar >,
        const int_t il, const int_t iu,
        const Scalar >, int_t& m, VectorW& w, MatrixZ& z,
        VectorIFAIL& ifail );
``


[heading Description]

`sbgvx` (short for $FRIENDLY_NAME) provides a C++
interface to LAPACK routines SSBGVX and DSBGVX. 
`sbgvx` computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally, eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite banded eigenproblem, of
the form A*x=(lambda)*B*x. Here A and B are assumed to be symmetric
and banded, and B is also positive definite. Eigenvalues and
eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either all eigenvalues,
a range of values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

The selection of the LAPACK routine is done during compile-time, 
and is determined by the type of values contained in type `MatrixAB`.
The type of values is obtained through the `value_type` meta-function
 `typename value_type<MatrixAB>::type`.
The dispatching table below illustrates to which specific routine 
the code path will be generated.

[heading Example]
``
#include <boost/numeric/bindings/lapack/driver/sbgvx.hpp>
using namespace boost::numeric::bindings;

lapack::sbgvx( x, y, z );

``

this will output
